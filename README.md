# 👋 About Me

I’m a backend-focused full-stack developer with 5+ years of professional experience, including 3+ years in web application development, building scalable and reliable systems using PHP, Laravel, MySQL, and RESTful APIs.

I specialize in backend architecture, API development, and database-driven applications, with hands-on experience in ERP, CRM, and e-commerce platforms. I enjoy turning complex business requirements into clean, maintainable, and efficient software.

My work focuses on:

✅ Scalable backend architecture  
✅ Enterprise ERP development  
✅ Database optimization  
✅ Secure authentication systems  
✅ Production-ready deployments  

I approach software with a **systems-thinking mindset** — designing technology that performs under pressure and scales with business growth.

# 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

> **"Good code works. Great systems scale."**

I prioritize:

- Performance over shortcuts  
- Clean architecture over quick fixes  
- Reliability over complexity  
- Long-term maintainability  

Because real engineering is about building software that lasts.
